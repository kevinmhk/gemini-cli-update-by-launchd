# Version 1.0

- **Date:** 9 Aug 2025
- **Platform:** Gemini CLI 0.1.18
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-pro

```
I want to convert what we did above into a mini project to store properly

Can you:
1) create a new project directory called "gemini-cli-update-by-launchd" under the current directory
2) Write your sample com.google.gemini.cli.update.plist file into the newly created directory
3) Write a new shell script file into the newly created directory. The script would check the npm path, update the sample plist file with the right path, copy the updated plist to the proper directory, and execute launchctl
4) Write a README.md file in the newly created directory detailing the whole design and usage
```
